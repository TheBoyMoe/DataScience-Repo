# Statistics in NumPy

The statistical concepts that we'll cover include:

- Mean
- Median
- Percentiles
- Interquartile Range
- Outliers
- Standard Deviation

We'll be analyzing single-variable datasets.

**Mean/Average**

`.mean` - built in function of numpy arrays used to calculate the mean/avg of a numpy array

```py
>>>survey_responses = [5, 10.2, 4, .3 ... 6.6]
>>> survey_array = np.array(survey_responses)
>>> np.mean(survey_array)
5.220
```
