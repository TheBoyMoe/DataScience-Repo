    "We can merge different `DataFrames` using the `.merge()` method. It looks for columns that are common between 2 `DataFrames` and then looks for rows where those column values are the same. It then combines the the matching rows into a single row in a new table.\n",

    "The `.merge()` method takes the two dataframes as args:\n",
