    "\n",
    "It improves upon `Matplotlib`, e.g. it natively supports `Pandas`, allows you to summarize large `Panda DataFrames` into aggregated charts. One of the most important tasks that Seaborn automates for us is calculating aggregate statistics over large datasets\n",

    "To import `Seaborn`, add the following line at the top of your script `import seaborn as sns`. You'll need to import `Pandas` aswell `import pandas as pd`."
