    "To establish notation for future use, we’ll use `x^(i)` to denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and `y^(i)` to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). A pair `(x^(i), y^(i))` is called a training example, and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of `m` training examples `(x^(i), y^(i));i=1,...,m` - is called a training set. \n",

    "**Note** that the superscript `(i)` in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use `X` to denote the space of input values, and `Y` to denote the space of output values. In this example, `X = Y = ℝ`.\n",

    "To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function `h : X → Y` so that `h(x)` is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of `y`. For historical reasons, this function `h` is called a `hypothesis`. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this:\n",

When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a **classification problem**."

Ideally, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set. In such a case, the value of J(θ_0, θ_1) will be 0. The following example shows the ideal situation where we have a cost function of 0.\n",

The circled x displays the value of the cost function for the graph on the left when θ_0 = 800 and θ_1 = -0.15. Taking another h(x) and plotting its contour plot, one gets the following graphs:\n",
