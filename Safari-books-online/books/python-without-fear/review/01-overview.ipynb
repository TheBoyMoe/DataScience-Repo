    "# Python basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most languages, Python has no “begin block” or “end block” syntax—all relationships are based on indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has no variable declarations. You create variables by assigning values to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is built heavily on the idea of iteration, which means looping through sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end of a physical line usually terminates a Python statement, there is no statement-terminator. However, an open parenthesis, curly brace, or bracket automatically continues the virtual line to the next physical line. an open parenthesis, bracket or curly brace, creates a situation in which you can freely continue the statement onto other lines, until the parenthesis, etc is matched. This is one case in which indentation doesn’t matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you really need to continue a physical line and have no alternative, you can use a backslash, `\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, integers are absolutely precise(never lose precision), which means that no matter how high they get, adding 1 always creates a new value. That is not true of floating-point numbers."
