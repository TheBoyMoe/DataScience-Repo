    "# Exercise 1.1 - Driving Linear Learner \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With Amazon SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides an integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance for easy access to your data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. It also provides common machine learning algorithms optimized to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment, with native support for bring-your-own algorithms and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Learner Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models are supervised learning algorithms used for solving either classification or regression problems. As input, the model is given labeled examples (x, y). x is a high dimensional vector, and y is a numeric label. \n",
    "\n",
    "- for binary classification problems, the algorithm expects the label to be either `0` or `1`. \n",
    "- for multiclass classification problems, the algorithm expects the labels to be from `0` to `N – 1`, where `N` is the number of classes. \n",
    "- for regression problems, `y` is a real number. The algorithm learns a linear function or linear threshold function for classification, mapping a vector `x` to an approximation of the label `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use a [Linear Learner algorithm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html) to teach a simulated car to stay on a simulated road. This is an example of supervised learning. The data created by the application and exported as a csv file is labeled, and we use `multiclass classification` - the car can move `left`, `right` or `straight`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will train a Linear Learner model to drive a car on a simulated track. First, you will create the IAM user and policy used in all the exercises. You will also create an AWS Cloud9 instance as a location to run the Python scripts used in this course. With a little extra configuration, you will then be able to run the scripts on your local environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the AWS Cloud9 instance, you will create training data by driving a car on a simulated track. You will use this data to create a training job. Using the resulting model, you will create an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. By using inference results from your endpoint, the car will be able to automatically drive on the track."
