    "# Exercise 3.2 - Using XGBoost Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will complete an Amazon SageMaker example notebook for Customer Churn Prediction with XGBoost. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular and efficient open source implementation of the gradient boosted trees algorithm. Gradient boosting is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining the estimates of a set of simpler, weaker models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example notebook, you will work with a dataset of customers from a fictional mobile operator. The dataset has a churn value, which indicates whether a customer left the service. At the end of the notebook, you will look at optimizing the threshold for predicted churn. A value is assigned to the four statesâ€”false positive, true positive, false negative, and true negative. You will use this formula to determine the cutoff value where costs are minimized.\n",
