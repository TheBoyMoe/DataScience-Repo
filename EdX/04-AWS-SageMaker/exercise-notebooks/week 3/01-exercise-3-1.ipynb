    "In this exercise, you will complete the Amazon SageMaker example notebook for k-means and the MNIST database of handwritten digits. K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to find discrete groupings in data. In this case, the data consists of samples of handwritten digits. The data is provided to the algorithm without labels, as k-means is an unsupervised algorithm.\n",
